# Bin2Embed
Bin2Embed is an open-source command-line tool that takes a binary file as input and generates a C++ header file that can be included in a project. The generated file contains a namespace called "embedded", which contains the raw binary data as a uint8_t array.

# Usage
Drag and drop onto the exe.
Execute exe with the file path as the argument.

This will generate a new file named file.embed in the same directory as the original file.
